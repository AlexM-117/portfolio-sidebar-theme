            I am a second-year student at Penn State University, majoring in
            Cybersecurity Analytics and Operations, with an expected graduation
            in Spring 2027. I bring hands-on experience in secure database
            development, cybersecurity research, and real-world technical
            projects. My background includes a strong foundation in programming
            and web development, with skills in Python, JavaScript, and SQL, as
            well as different cybersecurity practices such as developing and
            implementing a firewall. I actively apply my skills outside of the
            classroom through technical clubs like the Competitive Cyber
            Security Organization, Red Cell Analytics Lab, and Cybersecurity
            Consulting Club, where I've engaged in threat analysis, ethical;
            hacking, and real-time incident response.
